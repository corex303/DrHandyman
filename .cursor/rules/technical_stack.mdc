# Technical Stack: Dr. Handyman NC Website Revamp

The project leverages a modern, performance-oriented stack based on Next.js. Free and open-source solutions are prioritized.

## Recommended Core Stack:
- **Framework:** Next.js (React framework, focusing on SSG/SSR)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Backend/API:** Next.js API Routes (Node.js, including form data processing)
- **Forms (Client-side):** React Hook Form + Zod
- **Form Submission (Backend):** Next.js API Routes
- **Image Upload Handling:** Next.js API route with `multer`
- **Payment Processing:** Stripe Checkout
- **Authentication:** Custom cookie-based authentication via Next.js Middleware (for admin and worker portals). NextAuth.js may be used for other authentication needs if they arise.
- **Database:** Vercel Postgres or Firebase (evaluate free tiers)
- **Image Storage (Permanent):** Cloudinary, AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage (evaluate free tiers)
- **Admin Panel:** Simple admin panel built as part of the Next.js application (preferred)
- **Deployment:** Vercel or Netlify (evaluate free tiers)
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics
- **Version Control:** Git
