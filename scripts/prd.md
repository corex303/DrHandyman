## g. Technical requirements / stack

A guiding principle for technology selection is to prioritize free and open-source solutions whenever they meet the project's functional, non-functional, and scalability requirements. If paid services are considered, their free tiers should be thoroughly evaluated first.

**Recommended Simple Stack:**

*   **Framework:** Next.js (React framework, with a focus on Static Site Generation (SSG) for most public-facing pages for optimal performance and SEO).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (for rapid, consistent UI development with a utility-first approach).
*   **Backend/API:** Next.js API Routes (utilizing the Node.js environment for server-side logic, including form data processing).
*   **Forms (Client-side):** React Hook Form + Zod (for efficient form handling and robust schema-based validation).
*   **Form Submission (Backend):** Next.js API Routes will handle form submissions (e.g., storing data, sending email notifications).
*   **Image Upload Handling:** Next.js API route utilizing `multer` for processing and temporarily storing image uploads before moving to permanent storage.
*   **Payment Processing:** Stripe Checkout (for a secure, PCI-compliant, and minimally complex integration for online payments).
*   **State Management:** Primarily rely on Next.js/React component state and context API. A global state management library (e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit) is likely not needed for this project's scope but can be considered if complexity grows significantly.

**Alternative/Additional Considerations & Original Stack Components:**

*   **Database:**
      *   Primary Recommendations (for simplicity and quick setup):
          *   Vercel Postgres (Managed, serverless PostgreSQL, integrates well with Vercel deployments, offers a generous free tier).
          *   Firebase (Firestore - NoSQL, or Realtime Database - NoSQL) (BaaS with generous free tier, very easy to integrate and get started quickly, especially for simpler data models).
      *   Other Alternatives (Original):
          *   Self-hosted PostgreSQL (Robust, relational, open-source, offers maximum control but requires more setup and maintenance).
          *   Supabase (PostgreSQL-based BaaS, offers a free tier, good alternative to Firebase if relational data is strongly preferred).
      *   Evaluate free tier limitations and project data structure needs carefully when choosing.
*   **Authentication:**
      *   **Customer Logins:** NextAuth.js (highly recommended for its seamless integration with Next.js and comprehensive features for handling customer authentication, e.g., for viewing order history or managing saved payment methods if those features are added in the future). OAuth with providers like Google or Facebook should be considered for ease of customer login.
      *   **Admin & Worker Portals:** A simple, site-wide password-based authentication system. This should be robustly implemented (e.g., strong password hashing, rate limiting) but avoids the complexity of individual user accounts for these roles if not strictly necessary. If distinct access levels are needed between admin and worker, two separate passwords/access routes can be implemented.
*   **Image Storage (Permanent):**
    *   Primary Recommendation (Original): Utilize the free tiers of cloud-based solutions like Cloudinary (offers image manipulation) or other services providing object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage). Evaluate free tier limitations (storage capacity, bandwidth, feature restrictions) carefully. If self-hosting is not feasible, select the most cost-effective cloud solution that meets requirements, starting with its free tier.
*   **Admin panel/CMS:**
    *   Option 1 (Preferred for simplicity and control, aligns with Recommended Stack): Simple admin panel built as part of the Next.js application.
    *   Option 2 (If more complex CMS features are deemed necessary - Original): Headless CMS (e.g., Strapi (open-source, self-hostable), Sanity.io, Contentful). If a Headless CMS is chosen, prioritize self-hostable open-source options or those with comprehensive free tiers.
*   **Styling (Alternative):** CSS Modules (if Tailwind CSS is not preferred).
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Primary Recommendation (Original): Leverage the free tiers of platforms like Vercel (ideal for Next.js) or Netlify.
    *   Alternative (Original): For greater control or to minimize long-term costs, explore self-hosting on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) using Docker containers and open-source web servers like Nginx or Caddy. This requires more setup and maintenance effort.
*   **Analytics:** Google Analytics (for tracking website traffic and user behavior).
*   **Code repository:** Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
*   **Development environment:** Node.js, pnpm/npm/yarn.

## h. Design and user interface

*   **Branding:**
    *   Adhere to Dr. Handyman's existing branding elements (logo, color scheme if available).
    *   If no established branding exists, develop a new, professional color palette that evokes trust, reliability, and craftsmanship (e.g., blues, greens, greys, with accent colors).
*   **Visuals:**
    *   High-quality, professional photography is paramount, especially for the portfolio section. All "before & after" shots must be clear and well-lit.
    *   Stock imagery should be used sparingly and only if it is high-quality and aligns with the brand's professional image. Avoid generic or cliché stock photos.
*   **Layout:**
    *   Clean, modern, and uncluttered design aesthetic.
    *   Ample white space to improve readability and focus.
    *   Consistent layout structure across all pages.
    *   Mobile-first design approach, ensuring an excellent experience on smaller screens, then scaling up for tablets and desktops.
*   **Typography:**
    *   Use legible and professional web fonts. Choose a font pairing that is easy to read for both headings and body text.
    *   Ensure sufficient font sizes and line heights for readability, especially on mobile devices.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   Simple, intuitive, and consistent main navigation menu, easily accessible on all devices.
    *   Clear footer navigation for secondary links (e.g., privacy policy, terms of service, sitemap).
    *   Breadcrumbs on inner pages if the site structure becomes deep, to aid user orientation.
*   **Calls to action (CTAs):**
    *   Prominently displayed, clear, and concise CTAs (e.g., "Get a Free Quote," "View Our Work," "Pay Your Invoice," "Contact Us").
    *   Visually distinct CTAs using contrasting colors and clear button styling.
    *   Strategically placed CTAs to guide users towards desired actions.
*   **User experience (UX):**
    *   Intuitive user flows for all key tasks (e.g., requesting a quote, making a payment, uploading photos).
    *   Minimize clicks required to reach important information or complete tasks.
    *   Provide clear feedback to user interactions (e.g., form submission success/error messages, loading indicators).
    *   Ensure the website is accessible, aiming for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. This includes considerations for keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast.
*   **Forms:**
    *   Forms should be simple, with clearly labeled fields.
    *   Use inline validation and provide helpful error messages.
    *   Break down long forms into steps if necessary.

This PRD aims to cover all essential aspects for the Dr. Handyman NC Website Revamp. It should be considered a living document and may be updated as the project progresses and new information becomes available.
